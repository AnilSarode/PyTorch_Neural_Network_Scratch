## Planar data classification with one hidden layer

This is the git repository, which has a code file for Planner data classification using a two-layer Neural Network from scratch using Pytorch. 

The data and code reference is taken from the Andrew Ng Coursera course-https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/3.

- Implemented  a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Used units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh 
- Computed the cross-entropy loss 
- Implemented forward and backward propagation
- Trained model for 10000 iterations.
- Used the learn parameters to predict the class probabilities. 


The Neural Network model result is compared with Logistic Regression using sklearn.
